ent-RMCFiltration = water filtration system
    .desc = A water filter that separates both organic and inorganic matter, hazardous waste, and corrosive acids from water so it may be further processed.
ent-RMCFiltrationDisinfection = disinfection filter
    .desc = A water filter specifically designed to separate micro-organisms, such as viruses and bacteria, from water.
ent-RMCFiltrationDistribution = waste distribution system
    .desc = This machine separates the leftover waste from the purification processes to be discarded into space, recycled for supplies, or used for research.
ent-RMCFiltrationDistributionDamaged = { ent-RMCFiltrationDistribution }
    .desc = { ent-RMCFiltrationDistribution.desc }
ent-RMCFiltrationSedimentation = sedimentation filter
    .desc = A water filter specifically designed to capture and remove sediment, such as sand, silt, dirt, and rust, from water without removing the nutritious minerals for that crisp, clean taste every time.
ent-RMCFiltrationSedimentationAlt = { ent-RMCFiltrationSedimentation }
    .desc = { ent-RMCFiltrationSedimentation.desc }
ent-RMCCoagulationArm = coagulation arm
    .desc = An axel with four sides, made to spin to help filter the water.
